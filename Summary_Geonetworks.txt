## Summary of "Multilevel Visual Analysis of Aggregate Geo-Networks"

# General
- Modelling of urban phenomena (modeled as geo-networks)
- Show how phenomena spreads over geogprahical Location, also how geo networks affect each other (Analysis of multiple geo networks at once!)
- macro Level (all geonetworks), meso Level (compare certain geo networks), Micro Level (individual geo network)

# Limitations of current work
- current visualizations of geonetworks Show limitations --> multiple Maps, no decomposition for meso or Micro Level possible, limited geo networks shown (context switching needed to compare)

# Proposal in paper
- multiple-network-on-one-map
- shared egdes (like metro Maps)
	- reducing Edge Crossing
	- Level of Detail Rendering (summarizing end merging edges in different Levels to create better overview/structure; cluster geo networks in different hierachies)
- Discriminating networks
	- Coloring algorithm 

# Algorithms used
- Background layer that contains summary of all geo networks
- angle Adaption for Routing edges to reduce overlap of networks and get straight edges
- Crossing minimization algorithms for Edge crossings
- k Color coloring algorithm to Color edges such that they stay discriminable to their neighbour networks
- Level of Detail Rendering (placing nodes of networks in an order such that there is no Crossing of edges to other networks that also route through this node)

# User interaction
- pining and highlighting geo networks (done with opacity turned down, then relevant networks can be turned to opacity 1 again)

# Case studies
- good Usability 

# Limitations
- Only on dataset with over 300 geonetworks the algorithms took quite Long (36 sec), in General fast
- Locations Need to be sparsely distributed, otherwise nodes tend to overlap (possibility to summarize close Locations in more global Level to one - spatial simplification)
- hierarchical clustering wold perform better if weight/other Attributes are used for similarity measurements.
